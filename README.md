Welcome to the 3rd Annual Deep Learning Workshop presented by The OSCT at Marquette University! 

##  Hands-on-practice (Python)
In the workshop, we will be ustilizing [<strong>Google Colab</strong>](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) equipped with Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and GPUs to first develop the pipeline, and then train, validate, and test the contructed models. Using Google Colab, you don't need to install any software/library packages, everything is just ready to use.
